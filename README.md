- Round 5 Team Project in CMU ETC BVW (Build Virtual World)
- Assigned Theme: Festival - Novelty x Sopcial x Accessibility
- Project Duration: 2 weeks (Nov. 3, 2021 - Nov. 16, 2021)
- Tools: Unity3D, Vive Tracker, Makey Makey
- Platform: PC game / Vive Tracker, Makey Makey
- Team members: 
  - Programmers: Wei-Cheng Chen (Me), Hannah Baxter
  - Arts: Justin Yook, Jinman Li
  - Sounds: Tiange Zhou
- Introduction: Introduction: You are a mecha pilot trapped in an underwater lab, and your mission is to escape the tunnel before it is too late! However, there are other players escaping from the tunnel. Try your best to drive faster than other mechas! Specifically, we come up with the idea of using tee ball as the mecha's controller. Tee ball's flexibility in 2D shifting helps us create a smooth controlling experience for the players. Furthermore, we build a pedal with Makey Makey to handle mechas' engine operation.

# Notable Contributions
1. Implemented the player controller (physically and programmatically) with Vive tracker and Makey Makey for the Mecha
2. Design the tunnel layout and obstacle mechanisms (lazer, door with interactable button, and rotating fan)
3. Build the movement of Boids (splitting groups and wild behavior) for the fish to intensify player's immersive experience of underwater environment
